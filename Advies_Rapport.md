## 3 engines

### Unreal
Unreal engine is a high power engine built in C++ and used by everyone from the
small indie developer in your city, to the AAA videogame developer at Ubisoft.

[Unreal Engine documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com)

#### Pros:
* High power
* Allows for use of C++ but also allows for graphical development

#### Cons:
* Very resource intensive
* Not the most beginner friendly

### Godot
Godot is a relatively new engine on the game development scene. Released to the
public in 2014, it allows the developer to make 3d and 2d games in C# or native
godotscript (GDscript)

[Godot Documentation](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/)

#### Pros:
* Beginner friendly
* Fantastic Documentation
* Open source

#### Cons:
* Due to it being new, there are not many tutorials.

### Unity
Unreal engine is the largest competitor to Unreal engine. Equally as powerful,
using C# as their scripting language of choice, and plenty of documentation

[Unity Documentation](https://docs.unity.com/)

#### Pros:
* C# is a relatively beginner friendly scripting language.
* Lots of beginner friendly tutorials to get your grip with the engine.

#### Cons:
* Due to it being a C# focussed engine, it is hard to optimise performance for 
larger projects.
* C# is a mostly Object oriented programming language, which makes it hard for 
people that have a hard time with abstract structure types.
